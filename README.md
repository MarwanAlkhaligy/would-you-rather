# Would-you-rather-app
 
## Project Overview 

This project lets the user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Installation 
You need to have Node.js, npm and yarn installed.
Proceed with cloning or downloading the project as a zip.
Extract and change directory to the project folder.
Run yarn
Then run yarn start
Your default browser should open at port 3000 with the address: http://localhost:3000
You should be connected to the Internet as the app accesses images (user avatars).
